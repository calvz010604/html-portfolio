<h2>My Top 5 Movies.</h2>

<h3>1. Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
    “Ready Player One” is at once familiar in its fabric and forward-thinking in its technology, with a combination of gritty live action and glossy CGI. It’s an ambitious mix that can be thrilling while it lasts, and yet it fails to linger for long afterward, leaving you wondering what its point is beyond validating the insularity of ravenous fandom (Lemire, 2018).

<h3>2. Spider Man</h3>

    Just like Peter Parker, I can also be your friendly neighborhood, haha!.

<h3>3. Harry Potter (all movies)</h3>

<h3>4. Pacific Rim & Pacific Rim: Uprising</h3>
